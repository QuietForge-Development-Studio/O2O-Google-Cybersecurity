Update: The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. 

In the latest version, CSF v2.0, a new 'Govern' function has been added, emphasizing the importance of strong cybersecurity governance. This framework is widely respected and essential for maintaining security regardless of the organization you work for.

The CSF now consists of six important core functions: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover, which we'll discuss in detail in a future video.

CSF v2.0 also places greater emphasis on supply chain risk management.

Update: Govern Function 

A significant update in the latest version of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is the inclusion of a new core function: Govern. This function emphasizes the importance of strong cybersecurity governance across all levels of the organization. It's about establishing and maintaining the structures and processes needed to effectively manage cybersecurity risk. This includes things like setting clear cybersecurity objectives, ensuring leadership commitment, developing and implementing a comprehensive risk management strategy, and continuously improving cybersecurity performance.

Identify - management of cybersecurity risk and its effect on an organizations people and assets
Protect - strategy used to protect an organizarion through the implementation of policies, procedures, training, and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats
Detect - identify potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase speed and efficiency of detections
Respond - making sure the proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents and implement improvements to the security process
Recover - Recover - process of returning affected workstations back to normal operation
