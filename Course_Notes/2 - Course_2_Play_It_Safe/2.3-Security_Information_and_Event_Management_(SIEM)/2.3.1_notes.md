-    -real time visibility
    -event monitoring and analysis and autoimated alerts, 
    -stores log data in centralized location
    -index and minimize the number of logs one must manually review and analyze
    -must me continuously updated and modified 
# 2.3.1.3 SIEM dashboards
dashboards - present information in user-friendly ways that help us make better decisions.
metrics 0 key technical attributes such as response time, availability, and failure rate, which are used to assess the performance of a software application.
