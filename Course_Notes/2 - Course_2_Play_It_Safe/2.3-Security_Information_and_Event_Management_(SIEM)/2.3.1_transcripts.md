As a security analyst, one of your responsibilities might include analyzing log data to mitigate and manage threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. As a reminder, a log is a record of events that occur within an organization's systems and networks. Security analysts access a variety of logs from different sources. Three common log sources include firewall logs, network logs, and server logs. Let's explore each of these log sources in more detail.

A network log is a record of all computers and devices that enter and leave the network. It also records connections between devices and services on the network.
Play video starting at :1:2 and follow transcript1:02
Finally, a server log is a record of events related to services such as websites, emails, or file shares. It includes actions such as login, password, and username requests.
Play video starting at :1:18 and follow transcript1:18
By monitoring logs, like the one shown here, security teams can identify vulnerabilities and potential data breaches. Understanding logs is important because SIEM tools rely on logs to monitor systems and detect security threats.
Play video starting at :1:34 and follow transcript1:34
A security information and event management, or SIEM, tool is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. It provides real-time visibility, event monitoring and analysis, and automated alerts. It also stores all log data in a centralized location.
Play video starting at :1:58 and follow transcript1:58
Because SIEM tools index and minimize the number of logs a security professional must manually review and analyze, they increase efficiency and save time.
Play video starting at :2:9 and follow transcript2:09
But, SIEM tools must be configured and customized to meet each organization's unique security needs. As new threats and vulnerabilities emerge, organizations must continually customize their SIEM tools to ensure that threats are detected and quickly addressed.

We've explored how SIEM tools are used to collect and analyze log data. However, this is just one of the many ways SIEM tools are used in cybersecurity.
Play video starting at ::12 and follow transcript0:12
SIEM tools can also be used to create dashboards. You might have encountered dashboards in an app on your phone or other device. They present information about your account or location in a format that's easy to understand.
Play video starting at ::28 and follow transcript0:28
For example, weather apps display data like temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and the forecast using charts, graphs, and other visual elements. This format makes it easy to quickly identify weather patterns and trends, so you can stay prepared and plan your day accordingly.
Play video starting at ::48 and follow transcript0:48
Just like weather apps help people make quick and informed decisions based on data, SIEM dashboards help security analysts quickly and easily access their organization's security information as charts, graphs, or tables.
Play video starting at :1:5 and follow transcript1:05
For example, a security analyst receives an alert about a suspicious login attempt. The analyst accesses their SIEM dashboard to gather information about this alert. Using the dashboard, the analyst discovers that there have been 500 login attempts for Ymara's account in the span of five-minutes. They also discover that the login attempts happened from geographic locations outside of Ymara's usual location and outside of her usual working hours. By using a dashboard, the security analyst was able to quickly review visual representations of the timeline of the login attempts, the location, and the exact time of the activity, then determine that the activity was suspicious.
Play video starting at :1:53 and follow transcript1:53
In addition to providing a comprehensive summary of security-related data, SIEM dashboards also provide stakeholders with different metrics. Metrics are key technical attributes such as response time, availability, and failure rate, which are used to assess the performance of a software application.
Play video starting at :2:15 and follow transcript2:15
SIEM dashboards can be customized to display specific metrics or other data that are relevant to different members in an organization. For example, a security analyst may create a dashboard that displays metrics for monitoring everyday business operations, like the volume of incoming and outgoing network traffic.

# 2.3.1.5 Video: Parisa: The parallels of accessibility and security
0:00
[MUSIC] My name is Parisa and I'm a vice president of engineering and lead the Chrome Team. So as General manager of the Chrome Team, I lead a team of engineers and product managers and designers around the world who actually build Chrome and keep all of our users safe. I think accessibility is important to all aspects of technology, and when we think about its relevance for cybersecurity, you know, we ultimately want to keep everybody safe. I think of accessibility as making information, activities, or even environments meaningful, sensible, usable to as many people as possible. And when we're talking about this in a technology standpoint, it's usually about making information or services available to people with disabilities. Decisions we make based on our own abilities to enhance security can actually be ineffective. For example, you'll sometimes see the color red used for indication of a warning. Well, for somebody who's colorblind, like that is going to be ineffective. And so really thinking about accessibility when we're trying to keep people safe is super important for them to be effective. I've worked in the space of security for a really long time. And I do see some parallels between the spaces. I've really been able to see innovation driven when you're trying to solve a very specific security problem or a specific accessibility problem. Closed Captioning was originally designed and built to help people with hearing impairments, but it ends up helping everybody. For people who are new to the field of cybersecurity, it's just really important to remember that there's a range of abilities that you are wanting to serve. It's so important to get user research and feedback and a range of abilities in terms of testing the effectiveness of your security mitigations. I know it was scary for me early on. I didn't look like everybody else. I really struggled with whether I belonged. Finding people who could be mentors, having the courage to ask questions and recognize that you're rarely the only person with that question. And just sort of persevering through, sometimes hard moments can lead to breakthroughs and also just growing confidence. And one of the things I've learned is me having a different background than other people in this space was my own superpower. Instead of focusing on the delta between what I was and what the norm was in the room, I should feel a lot of pride in what made me unique and what unique skills and perspective I brought to the table.

Hello again! Previously, we discussed how SIEM tools help security analysts monitor systems and detect security threats.
Play video starting at ::11 and follow transcript0:11
In this video, we'll cover some industry leading SIEM tools that you'll likely encounter as a security analyst. First, let's discuss the different types of SIEM tools that organizations can choose from, based on their unique security needs.
Play video starting at ::29 and follow transcript0:29
Self-hosted SIEM tools require organizations to install, operate, and maintain the tool using their own physical infrastructure, such as server capacity. These applications are then managed and maintained by the organization's IT department, rather than a third party vendor. Self-hosted SIEM tools are ideal when an organization is required to maintain physical control over confidential data.
Play video starting at :1:1 and follow transcript1:01
Alternatively, cloud-hosted SIEM tools are maintained and managed by the SIEM providers, making them accessible through the internet. Cloud-hosted SIEM tools are ideal for organizations that don't want to invest in creating and maintaining their own infrastructure.
Play video starting at :1:19 and follow transcript1:19
Or, an organization can choose to use a combination of both self-hosted and cloud-hosted SIEM tools, known as a hybrid solution. Organizations might choose a hybrid SIEM solution to leverage the benefits of the cloud while also maintaining physical control over confidential data.
Play video starting at :1:39 and follow transcript1:39
Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud, and Chronicle are common SIEM tools that many organizations use to help protect their data and systems. Let's begin by discussing Splunk.
Play video starting at :1:54 and follow transcript1:54
Splunk is a data analysis platform and Splunk Enterprise provides SIEM solutions. Splunk Enterprise is a self-hosted tool used to retain, analyze, and search an organization's log data to provide security information and alerts in real-time. Splunk Cloud is a cloud-hosted tool used to collect, search, and monitor log data. Splunk Cloud is helpful for organizations running hybrid or cloud-only environments, where some or all of the organization's services are in the cloud.
Play video starting at :2:32 and follow transcript2:32
Finally, there's Google's Chronicle. Chronicle is a cloud-native tool designed to retain, analyze, and search data. Chronicle provides log monitoring, data analysis, and data collection. Like cloud-hosted tools, cloud-native tools are also fully maintained and managed by the vendor. But cloud-native tools are specifically designed to take full advantage of cloud computing capabilities such as availability, flexibility, and scalability.
Play video starting at :3:7 and follow transcript3:07
Because threat actors are frequently improving their strategies to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their targets, it's important for organizations to use a variety of security tools to help defend against attacks. The SIEM tools we just discussed are only a few examples of the tools available for security teams to use to help defend their organizations. And later in the certificate program, you'll have the exciting opportunity to practice using Splunk Cloud and Chronicle.

# 2.3.2.3 VIDEO: Talya: Cybersecurity field myths
0:03
I'm Talya, and I'm an engineer within privacy, safety and security at Google. So there are a lot of myths in the cybersecurity space. One big one is, you must know how to code, or you must know how to hack, or you must be a math wiz. I don't know how to code, although I have learned how to read code over time. I'm not a hacker. I'm not on the red team site of security, I'm more on like the blue team. I'm not a math wiz. I definitely took the business route, but I'm not a mathematician. That wasn't really the path. A lot of my strength really lies in my ability to build relationships, learn quickly on the job, doing, conducting research, asking all the right questions. I think those have been my strongest strength. Another big myth, is that, you are required to have a cybersecurity degree. I actually went to school for business, an advanced degree is not required. Even though I did later on go back, That was my preference. You do not need to pursue that in order for you to be considered a great candidate for cybersecurity. Another big one is you work in isolation within cybersecurity. It really depends on the path that you choose. But I found that to be one of the most that couldn't be further from the truth. My biggest advice for anyone who's interested in cybersecurity is, be okay with creating your own path. The path looks different for everyone. If you were to talk to five different people, their journeys are all different. So own your journey, and identify people who can support you. Let them know that you're sitting for the certificate, and see what support that you can get as you start your journey.
