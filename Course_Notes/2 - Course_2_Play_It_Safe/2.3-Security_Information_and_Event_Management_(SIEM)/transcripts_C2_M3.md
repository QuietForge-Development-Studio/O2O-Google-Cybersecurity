# 2.1.3.1 - Video: {"Video" <ChatGPT, please write a function that removes this unnecessary duplicate>} Threats, risks, and vulnerabilities ---------------------

As an entry-level security analyst, one of your many roles will be to handle an organization's digital and physical assets. As a reminder, an asset is an item perceived as having value to an organization. During their lifespan, organizations acquire all types of assets, including physical office spaces, computers, customers' PII, intellectual property, such as patents or copyrighted data, and so much more. Unfortunately, organizations operate in an environment that presents multiple security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities to their assets. Let's review what threats, risks, and vulnerabilities are and discuss some common examples of each.

A threat is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets. One example of a threat is a social engineering attack. Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Malicious links in email messages that look like they're from legitimate companies or people is one method of social engineering known as phishing. As a reminder, phishing is a technique that is used to acquire sensitive data, such as user names, passwords, or banking information.

Risks are different from threats. A risk is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. Think of a risk as the likelihood of a threat occurring. An example of a risk to an organization might be the lack of backup protocols for making sure its stored information can be recovered in the event of an accident or security incident. Organizations tend to rate risks at different levels: low, medium, and high, depending on possible threats and the value of an asset.

A low-risk asset is information that would not harm the organization's reputation or ongoing operations, and would not cause financial damage if compromised. This includes public information such as website content, or published research data.

A medium-risk asset might include information that's not available to the public and may cause some damage to the organization's finances, reputation, or ongoing operations. For example, the early release of a company's quarterly earnings could impact the value of their stock.

A high-risk asset is any information protected by regulations or laws, which if compromised, would have a severe negative impact on an organization's finances, ongoing operations, or reputation. This could include leaked assets with SPII, PII, or intellectual property.

Now, let's discuss vulnerabilities. A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat. And it's worth noting that both a vulnerability and threat must be present for there to be a risk. Examples of vulnerabilities include: an outdated firewall, software, or application; weak passwords; or unprotected confidential data. People can also be considered a vulnerability. People's actions can significantly affect an organization's internal network. Whether it's a client, external vendor, or employee, maintaining security must be a united effort.

So entry-level analysts need to educate and empower people to be more security conscious. For example, educating people on how to identify a phishing email is a great starting point. Using access cards to grant employee access to physical spaces while restricting outside visitors is another good security measure. Organizations must continually improve their efforts when it comes to identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities to minimize threats and risks. Entry-level analysts can support this goal by encouraging employees to report suspicious activity and actively monitoring and documenting employees' access to critical assets.

Now that you're familiar with some of the threats, risks, and vulnerabilities analysts frequently encounter, coming up, we'll discuss how they impact business operations.

"# 2.1.3.2  - Video: Key impacts of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities" {ChatGPT- please ensure this formatting in quotattions is established as standard build this into our structure or scrape or whatever}

In this video, we'll discuss an expensive type of malware called ransomware. Then we'll cover three key impacts of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities on organizational operations.
Play video starting at ::15 and follow transcript0:15
Ransomware is a malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data then demand payment to restore access. Once ransomware is deployed by an attacker, it can freeze network systems, leave devices unusable, and encrypt, or lock confidential data, making devices inaccessible. The threat actor then demands a ransom before providing a decryption key to allow organizations to return to their normal business operations. Think of a decryption key as a password provided to regain access to your data. Note that when ransom negotiations occur or data is leaked by threat actors, these events can occur through the dark web.

While many people use search engines to navigate to their social media accounts or to shop online, this is only a small part of what the web really is. The web is actually an interlinked network of online content that's made up of three layers: the surface web, the deep web, and the dark web.
Play video starting at :1:26 and follow transcript1:26
The surface web is the layer that most people use. It contains content that can be accessed using a web browser.
Play video starting at :1:34 and follow transcript1:34
The deep web generally requires authorization to access it. An organization's intranet is an example of the deep web, since it can only be accessed by employees or others who have been granted access.
Play video starting at :1:49 and follow transcript1:49
Lastly, the dark web can only be accessed by using special software. The dark web generally carries a negative connotation since it is the preferred web layer for criminals because of the secrecy that it provides.
Play video starting at :2:5 and follow transcript2:05
Now, let's discuss three key impacts of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. The first impact we'll discuss is financial impact. When an organization's assets are compromised by an attack, such as the use of malware, the financial consequences can be significant for a variety of reasons. These can include interrupted production and services, the cost to correct the issue, and fines if assets are compromised because of non-compliance with laws and regulations.
Play video starting at :2:40 and follow transcript2:40
The second impact is identity theft. Organizations must decide whether to store private customer, employee, and outside vendor data, and for how long. Storing any type of sensitive data presents a risk to the organization. Sensitive data can include personally identifiable information, or PII, which can be sold or leaked through the dark web. That's because the dark web provides a sense of secrecy and threat actors may have the ability to sell data there without facing legal consequences.
Play video starting at :3:20 and follow transcript3:20
The last impact we'll discuss is damage to an organization's reputation. A solid customer base supports an organization's mission, vision, and financial goals. An exploited vulnerability can lead customers to seek new business relationships with competitors or create bad press that causes permanent damage to an organization's reputation. The loss of customer data doesn't only affect an organization's reputation and financials, it may also result in legal penalties and fines. Organizations are strongly encouraged to take proper security measures and follow certain protocols to prevent the significant impact of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. By using all the tools in their toolkit, security teams are better prepared to handle an event such as a ransomware attack.

Coming up, we'll cover the NIST risk management framework's seven steps for managing risk.

2.1.3.3

The National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, is a federal agency that develops standards and guidelines to help organizations manage risk. The NIST risk management framework, or RMF, is a structured process that provides a systematic approach to managing risk. It consists of seven steps that organizations can follow to identify, assess, and mitigate risks to their assets.

My name is Herbert and I am a Security Engineer at Google. I think I've always been interested in security, in high school our school gave us these huge Dell laptops. There wasn't a whole lot of security within those computers. So, many of my friends would have cracked versions of like video games like Halo, that's really where I learned how to start manipulating computers to kind of do what I want. I guess [LAUGH] my day to day consists of analyzing security risks and providing solutions to those risks. A typical task for cybersecurity analysts would usually be something like exceptions requests. Analyzing if someone needs to have special access to a device or document based on the role that the person has or the project that they're working on. One of the more common threats that we come across is misconfigurations or requesting access for something that you don't really need. For example, I recently had a case where a vendor we were working with had changed their OAuth scope requests. And basically that means that they were requesting more permissions to use Google services than they had before in the past. We weren't sure really how to go about that because that wasn't a situation we've come across before. So it's still ongoing, but we're working with partner teams to kind of develop a solution for that. I think another thing that we've seen is outdated systems, machines that need to be patched. That sounds like an IT issue, but it's also definitely a cybersecurity issue. Having outdated machines, not having proper device management policies, working with a team or many teams is a huge part of the job. In order to get really anything done, you need to communicate with not just the team that you're a part of, but with other teams. Ten years ago I was working at a pizza joint and ten years later, here I am, at Google as a Security Engineer. If I told my 16 year old self that I would be here, I wouldn't have believed myself, but it is possible.

2.3.4
As you might remember from earlier in the program, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, provides many frameworks that are used by security professionals to manage risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
Play video starting at ::17 and follow transcript0:17
In this video, we're going to focus on NIST's Risk Management Framework or RMF. As an entry-level analyst, you may not engage in all of these steps, but it's important to be familiar with this framework. Having a solid foundational understanding of how to mitigate and manage risks can set yourself apart from other candidates as you begin your job search in the field of security.
Play video starting at ::44 and follow transcript0:44
There are seven steps in the RMF: prepare, categorize, select, implement, assess, authorize, and monitor.
Play video starting at ::59 and follow transcript0:59
Let's start with Step one, prepare. Prepare refers to activities that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs. As an entry-level analyst, you'll likely use this step to monitor for risks and identify controls that can be used to reduce those risks.
Play video starting at :1:20 and follow transcript1:20
Step two is categorize, which is used to develop risk management processes and tasks. Security professionals then use those processes and develop tasks by thinking about how the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and information can be impacted by risk. As an entry-level analyst, you'll need to be able to understand how to follow the processes established by your organization to reduce risks to critical assets, such as private customer information.
Play video starting at :1:56 and follow transcript1:56
Step three is select. Select means to choose, customize, and capture documentation of the controls that protect an organization. An example of the select step would be keeping a playbook up-to-date or helping to manage other documentation that allows you and your team to address issues more efficiently.
Play video starting at :2:19 and follow transcript2:19
Step four is to implement security and privacy plans for the organization. Having good plans in place is essential for minimizing the impact of ongoing security risks. For example, if you notice a pattern of employees constantly needing password resets, implementing a change to password requirements may help solve this issue.
Play video starting at :2:45 and follow transcript2:45
Step five is assess. Assess means to determine if established controls are implemented correctly. An organization always wants to operate as efficiently as possible. So it's essential to take the time to analyze whether the implemented protocols, procedures, and controls that are in place are meeting organizational needs. During this step, analysts identify potential weaknesses and determine whether the organization's tools, procedures, controls, and protocols should be changed to better manage potential risks.
Play video starting at :3:26 and follow transcript3:26
Step six is authorize. Authorize means being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organization. As an analyst, the authorization step could involve generating reports, developing plans of action, and establishing project milestones that are aligned to your organization's security goals.
Play video starting at :3:52 and follow transcript3:52
Step seven is monitor. Monitor means to be aware of how systems are operating. Assessing and maintaining technical operations are tasks that analysts complete daily. Part of maintaining a low level of risk for an organization is knowing how the current systems support the organization's security goals. If the systems in place don't meet those goals, changes may be needed.

Although it may not be your job to establish these procedures, you will need to make sure they're working as intended so that risks to the organization itself, and the people it serves, are minimized.
