Are you ready to start? If so, let's dive into our first question!

Brian
yes

Coach
Great! Let's get started.

Can you explain the importance of the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) in cybersecurity? How do these principles work together to protect information?

Brian
ive ansered this one twice, and been offered it four times. could you ask me questions relevent to the activity of drafting a professional statement

Coach
Thank you for your feedback! Let's focus on drafting your professional statement related to cybersecurity.

What key strengths do you believe are essential to highlight in your professional statement for a role in cybersecurity, and why do you think they are important?

Brian
great question, im going to reflect on it before responding. may I have one more related to this topic, but phrased like a diminutive muppet that lives on Degobah?

Coach
I love your creativity! Here’s a question in the spirit of a diminutive muppet from Degobah:

Hmm, strong you must be! What values, precious to you, should shine in your professional statement, yes? Why those values, hmm? 

Take your time to reflect on it!

Brian

Coach
Absolutely! Here’s another question for you:

In your professional statement, how can you connect your personal interests in cybersecurity to the goals of an organization? What specific examples might you include to illustrate this connection? 

Looking forward to your thoughts!
